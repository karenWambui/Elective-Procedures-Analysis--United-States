NB: LENGTH OF STAY(LOS)

**Executive Summary**
I used Power BI to create this project to analyze elective procedures across health service areas in the United States to understand discharge patterns,
length of stay (LOS), and cost drivers.Using hospital discharge data, the analysis identifies how patient severity, mortality risk, procedure type, 
and geography impact hospital utilization and cost efficiency.
The findings reveal that hip replacement is the most common elective procedure,New York City has the highest hospital concentration, and higher severity 
and mortality risk significantly increase LOS and cost.
These insights can support hospital administrators in optimizing capacity, managing costs, and improving patient flow.

**Business Problem**
Healthcare management sytems need to balance quality of care with operational efficiency and cost control.
Variability in patient severity,facility practices, and regional healthcare delivery makes it difficult to understand;
1.Why some hospitals have longer stays and higher costs than others
2.Which factors most strongly influence LOS and cost per discharge
3.Where opportunities exist to improve efficiency without compromising care.
The business problem was to identify key drivers of LOS and cost and highlight patterns that can inform better decison makin in regards to operational decisions.

**Methodology**
I got the dataset from Datacamp Platform,Cleaned data in Power Query
Used measures to calculate discharges,Average LOS,Average cost of discharge.
Calculated Columns
Grouped factors affecting average cost.
Performed data modelling

**Skills Used**
Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query)
Data modeling (relationships, calculated measures)
Healthcare domain understanding
Data visualization (Power BI dashboards)
Business interpretation and storytelling

**Results**
Total surgeons across the service area was 638.
The average LOS was 2.67
The Average cost per discharge was 21,000.
More females were discharged compared to men.
Hip replacement was the most common elective procedure with 26,286 discharges.
Patients aged 50–69 accounted for the highest discharge volume.
New York City had the highest number of hospitals across service areas.
Higher severity of illness and major/extreme mortality risk significantly increased LOS and cost.
Kings County Hospital Center had the highest average LOS (11.3 days).
Northern Dutchess Hospital had the lowest average LOS (1.4 days).

**Recommendations**
Investigate facilities with consistent high LOS and costs to understand best practices that can be standardized.                  
Track the trends over time to understand seasonal patterns and therefore more informed decisions.
Introduce predictive analytics to estimate LOS across facilities over time.
